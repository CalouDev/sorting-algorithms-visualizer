## Project Description

This project is a tool for visualizing the most popular comparison-based sorting algorithms. It displays the evolution of the array in real-time, with a customizable delay between each step.

```sh
gcc src/*.c -o bin/app -I include -L lib -lmingw32 -lSDL3 -lSDL3_ttf -mwindows

If you don't want to compile by yourself, you can just download the repo, a compiled .exe is already available in ./bin/
